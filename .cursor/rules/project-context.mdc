# TartanHacks - Scotty the Terrier Game

## Project Overview

A mobile-friendly HTML5 canvas game built for TartanHacks. The player controls Scotty the terrier, chasing squirrels and collecting dropped coins to reach a score of 100+ within 20 seconds.

## Tech Stack

- **Single-file HTML/CSS/JS** (`index.html`) — no build tools or frameworks
- **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering (2D context)
- **Virtual joystick** for touch/mouse input
- Designed for mobile-first with `touch-action: none` and `user-scalable=no`

## Architecture

- All game logic lives in an IIFE inside `index.html`
- Game loop runs at 60fps via `setInterval`
- Camera follows the player (Scotty) with world-to-screen coordinate conversion
- Squirrels use simple flee AI (flee when player is within 100px)
- Coins despawn after 8 seconds

## Key Constants

- `GAME_DURATION`: 20 seconds
- `SQUIRREL_COUNT`: 6
- `SCOTTY_SIZE`: 36, `SQUIRREL_SIZE`: 28, `COIN_SIZE`: 20
- Win condition: score >= 100

## Build & Size Check

When asked to check the byte size, run these commands and update the current size below:

```bash
tar -cf - index.html | brotli -q 11 -o app.tar.br
stat -f %z app.tar.br
```

**Current compressed size: 1807 bytes**

## Style Guide

- Gold/amber UI theme (`#e8c547`, `#d4a84b`, `#b8860b`)
- Dark HUD overlay with gradient backgrounds
- Keep the game lightweight — no external dependencies
